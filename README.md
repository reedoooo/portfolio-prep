## Description

This repository contains a portfolio project developed to showcase my skills as a software developer. The project is a personal portfolio website that provides comprehensive information about my skills, experiences, and projects I've completed. It also offers an interactive platform for users to contact me and learn more about my work in a simple and elegant manner.

I developed it using React.js as the main framework, applying its powerful features to create interactive user interfaces. Context API is used for state management across the application, ensuring efficiency and smoother user experiences. The project also heavily utilizes CSS and SCSS for custom styling and theming, providing the site with a visually appealing and unique design.

For handling user authentication and data protection, I employed the Auth0 authentication service, ensuring that user data remains secure. All these technologies come together to create a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly portfolio website that effectively highlights my skills and experiences as a software developer.
