## **About Myself**

- I am a Tech Innovator
- Empowering the world through creative technology solutions
- My name is Reed, and before I decided to become a software developer, I was self-employed trading stock options. I decided to learn software development because I have a brain that's almost obsessively oriented towards solving complex problems and planning, two skills that I've found very useful in my career thus far. I chose to specialize in Javascript because web-development venture I ever took into the coding world back in high school and I've loved it ever since. In my ideal environment, I would use javascript to help build websites that are useful in the healthcare industry. I believe my previous experiences in coding at CodeFellows Academy give me a strong foundation for my new career in tech. Thank you for considering me as a candidate.
- As someone new to tech, the mere idea of being able to build some of the ideas I've had over the years for useful applications is exciting. In general the endless possibilities to solve problems and improve people's lives through technology, and the ability to constantly learn and grow in this ever-evolving industry are what motivate me to continue coding.
